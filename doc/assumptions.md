## storeLocator

I assume this challenge had an invisible timeline so I worked to delivery as soon as possible, to build a production
ready system that follow good practices is not a fast task.

As I'm applying for a backend position I assume I may not need to focus so much in the front end, but I the same time I
can say that I put some effort to do things the right way there.
