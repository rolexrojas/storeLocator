## storeLocator

The current calculation mechanism work finding nearby stores in a straight line, it would be a great feature to be able
to find nearby stores by driving, walking or riding a bicycle. Adding a group radio element in the user interface to 
allow the client to choose the kind of calculation that wants to see.

Enabling cors by a WebMvc configuration Bean is something that would be nice to add.

Adding a logger throughout the several classes of the application is a must have feature in order to be actually ready
for production.
